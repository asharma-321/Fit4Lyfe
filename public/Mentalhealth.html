       <h4 class = "tabh">Cognitive Behavorial Therapy</h4>
       <p class = "tabh">Cognitive behavioral therapy is a psycho-social intervention that aims to improve mental health. CBT focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety. CBT is often used as an umbrella term referring to a number of cognitive and/or behaviour psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies.</p>

       <h4 class = "tabh">Psychodynamic Therapy</h4>
       <p class = "tabh">Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a form of depth psychology, the primary focus of which is to reveal the unconscious content of a client's psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension. In this way, it is similar to psychoanalysis. It also relies on the interpersonal relationship between client and therapist more than other forms of depth psychology.</p>

     <div id="Passion" class="tabcontent">
       <h2>How can passion relieve stress?</h2>
       <p class =  "tabh"><strong> Doing something you are passionate about is a good way to cope with stress. It distracts you from what you are doing, blocks some of your negative thinking, and allows you to focus on what you love doing.</strong></p>
       <h4 class = "tabh">Lists of Some Peoples Passion</h4>
       <h5 class = "tabh"><strong>~Excerise</strong></h5>
       <img src = "workout.jpg" class = "center-pic" Height = "200" Width = "300"/>
       <p class = "tabh">Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by: Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being. Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety.</p>
       <h5 class = "tabh"><strong>~Cooking</strong></h5>
       <img src = "cooking.jpg" class = "center-pic" Height = "200" Width = "320"/>
       <p class = "tabh">Psychologically, cooking is whats called behavioral activation. To put together a good meal, you have to be engaged and present. You need to taste, make snap judgments, add or subtract heat. You cant just stare out the window and think about your ex. Its a positive mindful activity filled with easy, achievable goals.</p>
       <h5 class = "tabh"><strong>~Dancing</strong></h5>
       <img src = "dancing.jpg" class = "center-pic" Height = "200" Wdith = "370"/>
       <p class = "tabh">The scientific reason for why dance has the ability to act as a stress reliever stems from the idea that when the body feels good, the mind does too. Any type of physical activity releases the neurotransmitter, endorphins, which serve to alleviate stress. Endorphins are the bodys natural painkiller to reduce stress and improve the mindâ€™s perception of the world.</p>
       <h5 class = "tabh"><strong>~Singing</strong></h5>
       <img src = "singing.jpg" class = "center-pic" Height = "200" Width = "350"/>
       <p class = "tabh">Older people had reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their saliva after singing, as well as improved mood and less tension. Changes in such markers are temporary, however, and may mean little in terms of health. Singing can also build up one's self esteem, alleviate loneliness, and make them confident to peform in public.</p>
       <h5 class = "tabh"><strong>~Playing an Instrument</strong></h5>
       <img src = "violin.jpg" class = "center-pic" Height = "200" Width = "350"/>
       <p class = "tabh">Playing an instrument forces you to take time away from the screen. With work, school, and socialising becoming increasingly reliant on technology, it seems we never take a step back and do an activity in the real world. Working with your hands, away from your phone or computer, is a perfect way to unwind.</p>
