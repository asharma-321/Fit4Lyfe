                don't forget that the anchor tag below this comment needs to link to Documents/aboutus.html
                if you look at your website right now, if you click "about us" your pretty background goes away
                because it opens the aboutus.html file that's in Users/Aayushi, NOT the correct aboutus.html file in Documents -->
