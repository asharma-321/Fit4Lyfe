       <p class = "tabh">Hypnosis is thought to work by altering our state of consciousness in such a way that the analytical left-hand side of the brain is turned off, while the non-analytical right-hand side is made more alert. The conscious control of the mind is inhibited, and the subconscious mind awoken. It is a guided way to help a perspn relax so they are able to slowly relieve there stress. It's also a therapy that helps break bad habits and stricly stays away from medication.</p>

       <h4 class = "tabh">Cognitive Behavorial Therapy</h4>
       <p class = "tabh">Cognitive behavioral therapy is a psycho-social intervention that aims to improve mental health. CBT focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions and behaviors, improving emotional regulation, and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety. CBT is often used as an umbrella term referring to a number of cognitive and/or behaviour psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies.</p>

       <h4 class = "tabh">Psychodynamic Therapy</h4>
       <p class = "tabh">Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a form of depth psychology, the primary focus of which is to reveal the unconscious content of a client's psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension. In this way, it is similar to psychoanalysis. It also relies on the interpersonal relationship between client and therapist more than other forms of depth psychology.</p>
